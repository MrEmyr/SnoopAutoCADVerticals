## Criteria for Archiving

Files were archived if they:
1. ✅ Described completed work no longer being developed
2. ✅ Were superseded by newer documentation
3. ✅ Represented historical development snapshots
4. ✅ Were no longer referenced by active docs

Files were **NOT** archived if they:
1. ❌ Were drawings (`.drawio` files)
2. ❌ Contained current technical specifications
3. ❌ Were actively maintained user guides
4. ❌ Described ongoing or future work
5. ❌ Were recently created (Nov 2025)

---

## Benefits

### ✨ Improved Organization
- Clear separation between active and historical documentation
- Easier to find current, relevant documentation
- Reduced clutter in main documentation folders

### 📚 Historical Preservation
- All historical documentation preserved for reference
- Development history maintained
- Design decisions and evolution documented

### 🔍 Better Navigation
- Active documentation folders contain only current files
- Archive clearly labeled and explained
- New contributors can focus on current docs

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Review active documentation structure
2. ✅ Update any links referencing archived files
3. ✅ Continue using active documentation for development
4. ✅ Add new documentation to appropriate active folders
5. ✅ Periodically review for additional archiving needs

---

**Archive Complete:** All outdated documentation organized ✅  
**Drawings Preserved:** All .drawio files intact ✅  
**Active Docs:** Clean and current ✅
